%% Lesson 5
% Written by Brenda So

%% Objective
% After this class, you should be able to:
%%
%
% * Go over debugging and publishing in MATLAB
% * Have a overview idea of the z transform 
% * Know how to plot pole zero plots of the z transform, and what to infer
% * Know how to input a signal to the transfer function of z transform
% * Know how to use the symbolic toolbox

%% Overview of the z transform
% The z transform converts a discrete time signal, which can be represented
% in real or complex numbers, into a sequence of complex exponentials.
% There are two key motivations of the z transform:

%%
% * By identifying the impulse response of the system we can determine how
% it would perform in different frequencies
% * By identifying the presence of increasing or decreasing oscillations in
% the impulse response of a system we can determine whether the system
% could be stable or not

%% Polynomials in MATLAB
% Before we step into z transform, we should take a look at what functions
% are there in MATLAB to evaluate polynomials. There are 4 major functions
% to know about -- polyval, root/poly and conv.

%% polyval
% Allows you to evaluate polynomials at specified values
%%
p = [2 -2 0 -3]     % 2x^3-2x^2 -3 
x = -5:.05:5;
a = polyval(p,x);
a2 = 2*x.^3 - 2*x.^2 - 3;
figure
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(x,a)
title('Using polyval')
hold on;
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(x,a2)
title('Using algebraic expression')
%%
% The graphs are the same!

%% roots/poly
% These two functions are direct opposites of one another. They allow you
% to find the root / coefficient of a vector of numbers
%%
r = roots(p)
p1 = poly(r) 

%% conv
% If Fontaine's talked about it, you mostly heard of convolution when you
% multiply in the frequency domain, i.e. when you feed a signal through a
% system, you need to multiply in the frequency domain. It is also used
% when you MULTIPLY TWO POLYNOMIALS TOGETHER!!!

%%
a = [1 2 -3 4];      
b = [5 0 3 -2];      
p2 = conv(a,b)       % Use convolution

%% Z transform 
% One of the things we usually evaluate in the z transform is the pole zero
% plot, since the pz plot can talk about stability and causality in
% different regions of convergence. Let us just look at one simple example
% of a pole zero plot

%% NOTE TO TUTOR
% The pedagogical value of this part is to first show one big pz plot,
% explain how to identify regions of convergence, stability and causality,
% and later on display different pz plot to visualize stability and
% causality

%% Z transform - generate a pole zero plot
% There are multiple ways to generate the pole zero plot. If you are
% interested, you should look up tf2zp (and its inverse, zp2tf), pzplot,
% etc. We are going to introduce the most simple function -- zplane. In the
% example, b1 and a1 and coefficients of the numerator and denominator,
% i.e, the transfer function. The Transfer function can be interpreted as
% the ratio between output (denominator) and input (numerator). At home, 
% you are going to explore how to use tf2zp
%%
b1 = [1];       % numerator
a1 = [1 -0.5];  % denominator
figure;
zplane(b1, a1)

%% BE CAREFUL!
% If the input vectors are COLUMN vectors, they would be interpreted as
% poles and zeros, and if they are ROW vectors, they would be interpreted
% as Coefficients of the transfer function. 

%% BE CAREFUL!
% zplane takes negative power coefficients, while tf2zp (the one where used
% in the homework) uses positive power coefficients. 

%% Z transform - More examples!

b2 = [1];
a2 = [1 -1.5];
b3 = [1 -1 0.25];
a3 = [1 -23/10 1.2];

% Example 1 : One pole, outer region is stable and causal
figure;
subplot(3,1,1);
zplane(b1,a1);
title('$$H_1(z)=\frac{z}{z-\frac{1}{2}}$$','interpreter','latex')
% Example 2 : One pole, outer region is causal but not stable, inner region
% is stable but not causal
subplot(3,1,2);
zplane(b2,a2);
title('$$H_2(z)=\frac{z}{z-\frac{3}{2}}$$','interpreter','latex')
% Example 3 : Two poles, outer region is causal, middle region is stable
subplot(3,1,3);
zplane(b3,a3);
title('$$H_3(z)=\frac{(z-\frac{1}{2})^2}{(z-\frac{4}{5})(z-\frac{3}{2})}$$',...
    'interpreter','latex')

%% On Stability and Causality
% The system is stable iff the region contains the unit circle
% The system is causal iff the region contains infinity 
% If there is an infinity to the pole, then it's not stable
% If all the poles are in the unit circle, then the system could be both
% stable and causal
%% Z transform - Impulse Response
% The impulse response is useful because the fourier transform of the
% impulse response allows us to evaluate what is going to happen at
% different frequencies.
[h1,t] = impz(b1,a1,8);     % h is the IMPULSE RESPONSE
figure;
impz(b1,a1,32);            % for visualization

%% 
% In DSP, you will learn how to go from impulse response to frequency
% response, but for now, if you want to know the frequency response, just
% take the short cut and use freqz ;)
%%
figure
freqz(b1,a1);

%% Z transform - Convolution
% After you obtain the impulse response, you can see what happens to the
% signal by convolving the impulse response with a signal
n = 0:1:5;
x1 = (1/2).^n;
y1 = conv(x1,h1);
figure;
subplot(2,1,1);
stem(y1);
title('Convolution between x_1 and h_1');
subplot(2,1,2);
y2 = filter(b1,a1,x1);
stem(y2);
title('Filter with b_1,a_1 and x_1');
xlim([0 14]);

%% Symbolic Toolbox
% The symbolic toolbox is useful if you want an exact expression of a
% function. In MATLAB, we often numerically evaluate functions, hence the
% symbolic toolbox could be useful in providing analytic solutions (when it
% can)
%%

% Differentiation
syms x y z
v = x^2 + 16*x + 5;
dvdx = diff(v)
dvdx_3 = subs(v, x,3)
% Integration
V = int(v)

% Integration with limits
syms a b
Vab = int(v,a,b);
V01 = int(v,0,1);

% Partial differentiation
w = -x^3 + x^2 + 3*y + 25*sin(x*y);
dwdx = diff(w,x);
dwdy = diff(w,y);

% third order derivative w.r.t. x
dw3dx3 = diff(w,x,3);

% solve
syms c
res = solve(c^2 - c + 1 == 4*c + 3);

%z transform
syms a n x
f = a^n;
ztrans(f, x)

% Other functions:
% simplify (sometimes...)
% Laplace, fourier, jacobian, curl, divergence...
% The symbolic toolbox is massive and powerful

% Can even handle matrices!
syms m
n = 4;
A = m.^((0:n)'*(0:n));
D = diff(log(A));



%% BE CAREFUL!
% Although we have used diff before, the diff used previously and the diff
% used in this context is not the same. Type 'help diff' and 'help
% sym/diff' if you want to learn more about it!
